### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.
```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log('hungry is', hungry);
  console.log('availableTime is', availableTime);
}
```
