# Primitive Data Types

### *What are they?*
Primitives are essential building blocks of data because they represent the simplest possible type of data that our software can have.

## The Six Primitive Types in JavaScript

* `undefined`
* `null`
* `boolean`
* `string`
* `number`
* `symbol` (introduced in ES6)

## Objects Are Not Primitives
* Anything not in that list is an object
* Arrays and functions are sub-category of objects
* Objects (including arrays, functions, and other types of objects) have *properties*.

### The six primitive types, plus `object`, make up the **seven fundamental types** of JavaScript
