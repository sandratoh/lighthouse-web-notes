# High-Order Functions

## Overview
* Functions that take in callbacks are referred to as **Higher Order Functions**.

* Functions are values


*(Notes: remember the 'receiver' functions of callback functions? Those are it!)*

### A more accurate definition:
Higher-Order functions are any functions which operate on other functions.
* includes, but not limited to, callbacks
* built-in functions that take in other functions are also included
  *  Eg: `forEach`, `filter`

### Benefits of Higher-Order Functions
* Composition - allow us to compose a lot of smaller functions and put in one big function
* Less bugs and less time
