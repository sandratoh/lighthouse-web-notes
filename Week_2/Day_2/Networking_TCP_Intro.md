# Intro to Networking and TCP

## Networking

> A (Computer) Network is when two or more computers are conected and can communicate with each other.

* Networks can connect *directly* and *indirectly*.
  * Directly: connecting our phone directly to our laptop via USB Cable or bluetooth connection
  * Indirectly: connecting laptop and phones to the same WiFi router - the two devices can send messages between each other, and are therefore networked

> Networking is *not* just about the internet!

* The internet is a network, but a network is not the internet.
* Networking can happen at a much smaller scale, even just  etween two devices

> The internet is the world's largest and best known network.

## TCP

> **TCP** stands for *Transmission Control Protocol*. It provides a standard that allows machines to speak to each other.

* Specific type of prototcol that is commonly used to structure t he data and workflow of data over the network

* TCP based communication allows two machines to establish an open channel for two-way data communication

* Once establish, both parties can start sending and receiving data until one of them terminates the connection

## Phone Call Analogy

* **IP Address**: IP stands for 'Internet Protocol'. The address part refers to a unique number that gets linked to all online activity you do on the computer.
  * Like a phone call, there is always one side that dials a specific number to establish a connection to the other side => IP Address is that number in computer networking!

* **Ports**: a port is a communicate end point
  * Think of it as like a company that has many different offices, and so there are many different phone extensions. This is what ports is like in computer networking

## More definitions

* **LAN**: Local Area Network - your home network vs your neighborhood's network, your network is local to your home

* **NIC**: Network Interface Card - acts as the ear and mouth of computers

* **WAN**: Wide Area Network - huge network by connecting many different networks together

* **MAC Address**: unique to each computer's NIC, and identifies each computer
  * 48 bits or 6 bytes (2 digits per byte)
  * Can be written in either way
    * 00:00:AB:13:5A:2C
    * 0000.AB13.5A2c
