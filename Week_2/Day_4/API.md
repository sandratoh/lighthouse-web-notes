# What is an API?

* **API** (Application Programming Interface) allows systems to work together

* Allow us to leverage the functionality of external services

* Sets of requirement that govern how one app can talk to another
  * Example: copy and pasting from one program to another
  * Example: sharing your game high score to your FB friends

### *How does it do it?*

* By 'exposing' some of a program's internal functions to the outside world in a limited fashion, outside program has access to a specific set of features
  * More efficient than code-sharing on a large scale
  * Avoids running into licensing issues if not careful

### Modern Web Services and API

* Because of API, it is possible to have our current sprawyling array of Web-serve 'mashups'

* Utilizing social media sign ins, or location access for instance

### Beyond the Web

* Concept of API has reached well beyond web applications

* Hardware devices, wearable devices, and many more are offering APIs as well.
