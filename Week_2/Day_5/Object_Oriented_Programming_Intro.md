# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

## What is Object Orientation?
* *Object Orientation* ("OO") is a software development paradigm

* *Object Orientation Programming* ("OOP") - the practice of using objects to keep codes modular and reduce repetition

* Many modern languages have been designed mainly for OOP or are *predominantly* OO:
  * C++
  * C#
  * Java
  * Python
  * Ruby
  * PHP
  * Swift
  * Objective-C

* Some other languages chose *Functional Programming* (FP)
  * Erlang
  * Common Lisp
  * Elixir
  * Haskell
  * Clojure

## JavaScript and OO:
* JS has multiple paradigms: initially popularized FP, but was also object-oriented.

* ES6 brought in more OOP features and enhanced the language

* Having multiple paradigms make a language more flexible and powerful, but also tends to cause confusion among community.
